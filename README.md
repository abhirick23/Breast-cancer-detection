# Breast-cancer-detection

Breast cancer forms in breast cells and is considered as a very common type of cancer in women. Breast cancer is also a very life-threatening disease of women after lung cancer. A convolutional neural network (CNN) method is proposed in this study to boost the automatic identification of breast cancer by analyzing hostile ductal carcinoma tissue zones in whole-slide images (WSIs). The paper investigates the proposed system that uses various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures to automatically detect breast cancer.


Within Deep Learning, a Convolutional Neural Network or CNN is a type of artificial neural network, which is widely used for image/object recognition and classification. Deep Learning thus recognizes objects in an image by using a CNN. CNNs are playing a major role in diverse tasks/functions like image processing problems, computer vision tasks like localization and segmentation, video analysis, to recognize obstacles in self-driving cars, as well as speech recognition in natural language processing. As CNNs are playing a significant role in these fast-growing and emerging areas, they are very popular in Deep Learning.
